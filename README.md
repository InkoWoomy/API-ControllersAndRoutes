Day 1 - Today we are learning about Controllers and Routes

We are going to start by creating a Controller with Routes that Allow you to:
    1. Retrieves a list of Students - HttpGet
    2. Add a Student - HttpPost
    3. Deletes a Student - HttpDelete - don't hard delete
    4. Edit a Student - HttpPut

Give our Endpoints different Routes - Adding a specific path for the Endpoint

Pass data through Routes - to pass data through add /{parameter name} to the route for each parameter
